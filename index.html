          William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an
          American business magnate, software developer, investor,
          and
          philanthropist.
          He is best known as the co-founder of Microsoft
          Corporation. During his career at Microsoft, Gates
          held the positions of chairman,
          chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief
          software
          architect, while also being the largest individual
          shareholder until May 2014.
          He is one of the best-known entrepreneurs and pioneers
          of
          the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.

        BASIC

        MITS Altair 8800 Computer with 8-inch (200 mm) floppy disk
        system, of which the first programming language for the
        machine was <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>'s
        founding product, the
        Altair BASIC
        Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics
        which demonstrated the Altair 8800, and he contacted Micro
        Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them
        that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for
        the platform. In reality, Gates and Allen did not have
        an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely
        wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts
        agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course
        of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on
        a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The
        demonstration was held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New
        Mexico; it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to
        distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS hired
        Allen, and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to
        work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their
        partnership "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer"
        and "software", and their first office was in Albuquerque.
        The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high
        school collaborator Ric Weiland. They dropped the hyphen
        within a year and officially registered the trade name
        "Microsoft" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on
        November 26, 1976. Gates never returned to Harvard to
        complete his studies.

        Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer
        hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had
        leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed. In
        February 1976, he wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the
        MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of
        the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft
        for it and the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of
        eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to
        produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.
        This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but
        Gates persisted in his belief that software developers
        should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became
        independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to
        develop programming language software for various
        systems. The company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue,
        Washington on January 1, 1979.

        Gates said that he personally reviewed and often rewrote
        every line of code that the company produced in its first
        five years. As the company grew he transitioned to a manager
        role, then an executive.

        IBM partnership
        IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to
        commercial enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in
        July 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal
        computer, the IBM PC. IBM first proposed that Microsoft
        write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's representatives also
        mentioned that they needed an operating system, and Gates
        referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the
        widely used CP/M operating system. IBM's discussions
        with Digital Research went poorly, however, and they did not
        reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams
        mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent
        meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an
        operating system. A few weeks later, Gates and Allen
        proposed using 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M,
        that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had
        made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a
        deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS,
        and later the full owner. Microsoft employed Paterson to
        adapt the operating system for the PC and delivered it
        to IBM as PC DOS for a one-time fee of $50,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than the contract itself, which earned Microsoft a
        relatively small fee, the prestige brought to Microsoft by
        IBM's adoption of their operating system was the origin of
        Microsoft's transformation from a small business to the
        World's leading software company. Gates had not offered to
        transfer the copyright on the operating system to IBM
        because he believed that other personal computer makers
        would clone IBM's PC hardware. They did, making the
        IBM-compatible PC, running DOS, a de facto standard. The
        sales of MS-DOS (the version of DOS sold to customers other
        than IBM) made Microsoft a major player in the industry.
        The press quickly identified Microsoft as being very
        influential on the IBM PC. PC Magazine asked if Gates was
        "the man behind the machine?".

        Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25,
        1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state
        and made Gates the president and chairman of the board, with
        Paul Allen as vice president and vice chairman. In early
        1983, Allen left the company after receiving a Hodgkin
        lymphoma diagnosis, effectively ending the formal business
        partnership between Gates and Allen, which had been strained
        months prior due to a contentious dispute over Microsoft
        equity. Later in the decade, Gates repaired his
        relationship with Allen and together the two donated
        millions to their childhood school Lakeside. They
        remained friends until Allen's death in October 2018.
